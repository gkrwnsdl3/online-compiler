We have seen that http does all kinds of magic, and moreover the world i dream of contains ppl just sticking up a mouse,keyboard and monitor to network and boot through it. Then start playing whatever movies they want, or compile their very big codes or edit their documents and all. Google took forward this step and created docs.google.com around the same time i got the idea. It was just a matter of designers, which i lacked. And now since we have these many. I propose the idea of online compilers. abstractly speaking an user pastes his code into a form ,not exactly upload the file, Then  the  script is compiled and the errors or warnings are shown. Necessary inputs are asked and outputs are displayed. I think this can be done easily using AJAX. Just imagine u dont need a very big compiler at your desktop and moreover the code is almost platform independent. Just imagine the havocs u must have been faced while a code is properly run on TC and it shows a handful of errors in GCC. All this is gone. Interested buddies can put their names down. Believe me it is not that easy as you might think.
